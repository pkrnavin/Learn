## commit particular correction from file
-- 2015-10-05

Git commit particular correction from file
- Open Index Editor 
- thinks, starts from Leftmost: `Head`, center: `Index` & Rightmost: `Working tree`, move the corrections from `Working Tree` TO `Index` and save.
- Modified file, say directive.js would be Modified and Staged, add other file to commit mark as Stage
- Commit the corrections with Staged changes

## Git rebase after resolve conflict, to commit corrections, thinks TODO below

- Git branch pull `rebase` is enabled; after pull conflicts occurred & resolved, 
- Repository folder changes as `rebasing`, once comes cannot commit corrections by using `Commit` button, thinks 
- have to click `Merge` button; thinks windows shows 3 options (`Continue`, `Skip` & `Abort`) 
    all changes are fine correct to commit, have select `Continue` and commit 

Note Thinks below:
Branch pull has `Merge`, `Rebase`
Merge:
- While Pull or merge from branch to branch, `Merge` automatically add commits, if conflicted & resolved, once `Commit` clicks message comes automatically, say commit msg `Merge resolve with conflicts...`, thinks

Rebase:
- With `Rebase`, thinks not adds commits from other branch, THINKS; once conflicted & resolved; manually to click `Merge` button after commits, doesn't add msg `Merge resolve with conflicts...`, thinks,
