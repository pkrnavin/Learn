- java practices instructions, notes to adds 

- in java class, `Database` Connection gets to adds (i.e. `DatabaseMaster.java` java class to adds; the database Connection properties, of IP Address DatabaseName, Password, ..., are to add in `properties` files, to load from the file, method `loadDatabaseProperties` to load from the file in static variable sets, to adds, the database driver of `com.mysql...` for mysql, `com.postgres...` for postgres to add in the class, to get `getDatabaseConnection`; Database connection related are to add in the class, `loadDatabaseProperties`, `getConnection`, `commit`, `rollback`, close of `Connection`, `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet`, to add in the class), 
- java of application same values are to LOADS ONE TIME, 
	- `OpenMentor`, of `Vocabulary Check Game`, the words from the file are loads one time of Tomcat starting, in static variable sets; of user enters words are valid to verify, from the variable to verify of exists; of one time to load words from the file, sets in static variable; in `InitServlet.java`, the words to load from the file, method adds, below the class notes adds 
	- `InitServlet.java`, servlet in `init` method to adds to loads one time of Config properties, Database properties, Mail properties, ..., are to adds; the java class in `web.xml`, `load-on-startup` to add, of Tomcat startup, the class servlet `init` method calls, loads sets in static variable 
	- `Appedo`, of values `counter_types`, agent downloads file full path, to load from database, of application same values, are to loads one time, in `InitServlet` the method calls 
	- `/reloadVocabularyCheckWords` `/reloadProperties`, `/reloadAgentDownloadsFilePath` servlet URL adds, of value change in the file, properties file, database, in application to set the change values, in the request, reloads calls of words to reloads, properties, database values, in `firefox` the URL to enters, in the application changes value sets 
- DAILY BACKUPS, TO TAKE of before day closes OR morning before starting changes, 	(modified on `2018-09-04`)
- in java, from UI values enters, to gets 
	- in controller (i.e. servlet), from the request values to gets in `Bean` class to set, the values, to calls manager class function 
	- manager class, to add; business logic to add in the class in method add; from manager DBI class method to calls 
	- DBI class, of database query `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, ..., query to add in the class method to add; from Bean, the values get add in database 
>> (i.e. from UI `form` values to insert in database; in controller the request to handles to adds, from request the values get to set in Bean class, manager class method to calls to insert the values, the Bean to pass to manager class the method, business logic to add in the method of manager class, from manager class DBI class's insert method to calls, the Bean to pass to DBI class insert method, in the method from Bean values get, to `INSERT INTO <TABLE>` DATABASE, to adds)
Note: in `Manager`, `DBI`, `Bean` classes, NOT TO ADD STATIC METHODS, VARIABLES; the classes methods are calls of to create object (i.e. <CLASS_NAME> obj = new `CLASS_CONSTRUCTOR`(), of object create, to calls); of respective requires static methods, variable to adds, of `static` in application same value sets 
- An action to does, to add in function, of each actions each method to adds 	(added on `2018-08-27`)
- `UtilsFactory.java` class, static methods, variables of commons to adds (i.e. `replaceNull`, `clearCollectionHierarchy`, `DateFormat` methods, close file Input, OutPut Stream Writer, ..., to adds), in static methods, variables of common to adds 
- `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `ArrayList`, `HashSet` to adds, of data to adds  
- Close resources of `Database`, `File` in respective order, in `finally` block, to call close 
	- of Database, to close of first to calls `ResultSet`, (`Statement` | `PreparedStatement`), `Connection`, in the respective order to call close 
	- of File, to close of first to calls `Buffered` Input|Output Stream|Writer, Input|Output to close 
	>> (i.e. variable value sets, from bottom to top to close) 
- SingleTone class, in RESETLet, the application same values are adds, thinks; in `OpenMentor` index page, 3rd slide, of get user registrations, recorded webinar videos, in SingleTone class values gets from database, of sets in variable, of `TimerClass` the value change reset, of 2 hrs OR 1 day, adds thinks, so for all users accessing the application, in the slide same values shows for all users, thinks, 
- java method name to starts with verb, variable name adjective prefix `dataType in short`, class name noun, thinks 
	- method name, of verb to starts with, common method names starts with are `get`, `set`, `load`, `is`, `has`, `do`, `create`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `search`, 
	- variable names of adjective thinks, of prefix datatype, below thinks 
		<DATA_TYPE>	<PERFIX_DATA_TYPE_VARIABLE_NAME> prefix, below starts with 
		String				str
