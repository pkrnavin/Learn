		Pythagoras property is a very useful tool in mathematics. It is formally proved as a
		theorem in later classes. You should be clear about its meaning.
		It says that for any right-angled triangle, the area of the square on the hypotenuse is
		equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the legs.
		Draw a right triangle, preferably on
		a square sheet, construct squares on
		its sides, compute the area of these
		squares and verify the theorem
		practically (Fig 6.26).
		If you have a right-angled triangle,
		the Pythagoras property holds. If the
		Pythagoras property holds for some
		triangle, will the triangle be right-
		angled? (Such problems are known as
		converse problems). We will try to
		answer this. Now, we will show that,
		if there is a triangle such that sum of
		the squares on two of its sides is equal
		to the square of the third side, it must
		be a right-angled triangle.If you have a right-angled triangle,
